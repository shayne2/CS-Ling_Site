<p>Welcome to the home page for the <b>Computer Science + Linguistics</b> undergraduate degree program at UIUC!</p><br>
<img src="images/Home.jpg"><br>
<p>Starting in Fall 2014, the departments of Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Illinois began offering a degree that allows students to pursue a career in computer science and linguistics. The CS + Linguistics program ushers in a new level of partnership between the College of Engineering (ENG) and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) and offers an innovative approach to education in both fields. CS + Linguistics allows students to enroll in a new program of study that provides a strong background in computer science as well as a rigorous training in liberal arts and sciences.</p><br>
<p>Recognizing the diversity of applications and disciplines as well as the challenges faced in the 21st century, the CS + Linguistics program at the University of Illinois is positioned to offer students unique opportunities for an interdisciplinary education. It prepares them for careers in emerging industries and offers a solid foundation for admission to graduate school. The CS + Linguistics degree provides grounding in both theory and in practice, ensuring that the students' education meets and exceeds industry standards.</p><br>
<p>The CS + Linguistics program brings together students and faculty interested in different aspects of the computer-natural language relationship - i.e., studying the cognitive aspects of natural languages; endowing computers with human-like behavior and understanding of spoken and written natural language; and designing user-friendly computer programs and interfaces using natural language communication.</p><br>
<p>Students will be exposed to the tools of both disciplines - formal methods, philosophical analysis, computer programming, and empirical research - with the aim of acquiring the appropriate skills required by the field. Graduates will be successful in landing jobs in various areas, including natural language software design and applications, teaching and research, law, medicine, and public service. The innovative aspect of the program is its focus on relating computers to language, technology, and society where the combination has potential for great impact.</p><br>
