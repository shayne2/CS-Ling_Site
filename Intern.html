<h2>Internships and Jobs</h2>
	<p>If you are interested in preparing for a job or internship, <a href="https://courses.illinois.edu/schedule/terms/LING/490" target="_blank">LING 490 (56284)</a> - <a href="http://compsem.ai.uiuc.edu/girju/Ling490.CareerSuccess.html" target="_blank">Seminar in Linguistic Analysis (Preparing for Career Success)</a> is the perfect class for you. The course will teach personal development, and many invited speakers from industry will offer their experience.</p><br>
	<p>Keep in mind that students in the Computer Science + Linguistics program have access to resources provided by both the <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/students/" target="_blank">general campus career center</a> as well as <a href="http://ecs.engineering.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">engineering career sevices</a>.</p><br>

	<h3>Finding positions</h3>
	<p>In addition to using search engines and job search sites, you can use <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/students/jobs" target="_blank">online resources provided by the career center</a>. One of the best resources for UIUC students to find employers and positions is <a href="https://i-link-illinois-csm.symplicity.com/students/" target="_blank">I-Link</a>. Start using this free resource as soon as possible.</p><br>
	<p>You may find the following career pages from Computational Linguistics programs of other Universities helpful.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://clabu.bu.edu/careers.html" target="_blank">Boston University</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.cla.csulb.edu/departments/linguistics/careers-computational-linguistics/" target="_blank">California State University, Long Beach</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://vervet.ling.washington.edu/db/livesearch-job-form.php" target="_blank">University of Washington's (Job Search Database)</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The following database can be extremely helpful as well.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://linguistlist.org/jobs/search-job1.cfm" target="_blank">Linguist List</a></li>
	</ul>
	<p>Here are just a few companies that do work in applications of Computational Linguistics/Natural Language Processing.</p>

		<li>IBM</li>
		<li>Clarabridge</li>
		<li>Lexalytics</li>
		<li>Idibon</li>

	<h3>Write and Edit your R&eacutesum&eacute</h3>
	<p>Once you have found a position to apply for, you will almost certainly need a r&eacutesum&eacute in order to begin the application process. Fortunately the career center provides <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/students/resume" target="_blank">general information about r&eacutesum&eacutes</a> online, hosts <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/services/workshops" target="_blank">r&eacutesum&eacute-writing workshops</a> to help get you started, and even holds <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/about/hours" target="_blank">walk-in r&eacutesum&eacute reviews</a> where students will review your r&eacutesum&eacute with you and offer suggestions. You may want to search the web for LaTeX templates for Computer Science-specific r&eacutesum&eacutes.</p><br>
	<h3>Interview Process</h3>
	<p>You will most likely be interviewed as part of the application process. The career center provides <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/students/interview" target="_blank">general information about interviewing</a> and host <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/services/workshops" target="_blank">interview workshops</a> that touch on the types of interviews and provide tips and strategies for a stronger interview. In addition, the career center provides students with the opportunity to practice interview skills by participating in a <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/services/mockinterviews" target="_blank">mock interview</a>.</p><br>
	<h3>Campus Career Fairs</h3>
	<p>Another great way to connect with employers and recruiters is during a career fair on campus. In addition to the <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/content/all-campus-career-fair-students" target="_blank">All Campus Career Fair</a>, multiple campus departments host <a href="http://ecs.engineering.illinois.edu/recruiting-students/career-fairs/" target="_blank">career fairs</a> throughout the year including the <a href="http://academics.aces.illinois.edu/content/aces-and-sciences-career-fair" target="_blank">College of ACES</a>, the <a href="https://www.careercenter.illinois.edu/events/2015/02/04/business-career-fair" target="_blank">College Business</a>, and the College of Engineering, which hosts the <a href="http://expo.ec.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">Engineering Employment Expo</a>. It is important to know that students of all majors are invited to attend all of these career fairs. This means that Computer Science + Linguistics students can attend not only the All Campus Career Fair and Engineering Employment Expo, but also the fairs hosted by the college of ACES and the college of Business, etc. Computer Science + Linguistics students should make a point to attend the <a href="https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/conference/2015/" target="_blank">Reflections and Projections Conference/Career Fair</a> hosted by the <a href="https://www-s.acm.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">UIUC brach of the Association for Computing Machinery</a>.</p><br>
	<p>Stay informed as career fairs approach, because, for example, while recruiters are on campus for the Engineering Employment Expo, engineering career services asks them to voluteer their time and conduct mock interviews and review r&eacutesum&eacutes with student.</p><br>
