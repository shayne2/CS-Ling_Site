<h2>Transferring Into the Program</h2>
		<p>What follows is information for students looking to transfer from another campus program. Those wishing to transfer into the program who are not already UIUC students should follow <a href="http://www.admissions.illinois.edu/apply/transfer/process" target="_blank">general instructions for transfer applicants</a>.</p><br>
		<p>In addition to the Computer Science major in the school of Engineering, UIUC offers 6 Computer Science programs in the College of LAS: Computer Science and Math, Computer Science and Statistics, Computer Science + Anthropology, Computer Science + Astronomy, Computer Science + Chemistry, and, of course, Computer Science + Linguistics. Due to the high demand of computer scientists in the work force today, many students are looking to transfer into a Computer Science-related major. The Computer Science department is growing very quickly to accomodate students. Even so, there is not space for all students who wish to transfer. When the Computer Science department considers transfer applicants for the Computer Science + Linguistics major, they look for genuine interest in Linguistics, as to eliminate students that are just looking for any way to get into Computer Science courses.</p><br>
		<p>The transfer requirements for the Computer Science + Linguistics program as of Fall 2015 are as follows:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Student must have a GPA of at least 3.50.</li>
			<li>Student must take at least two courses required for the CS portion of the degree <b>on this campus</b>, excluding CS 125. (Typically, these courses would be CS 173 and CS 225.) Grades of at least B+ must be earned.</li>
			<li>Student must take at least two courses required for the Linguistics portion of the degree with grades of at least B.</li>
		</ol><br>
		<p>The Linguistic advisor for the Computer Science + Linguistics major, <a href="http://compsem.ai.uiuc.edu/girju/" target="_blank">Professor Girju</a>, acts as the primary representative for the program. Students planning to transfer into Computer Science + Linguistics should also meet with an advisor in the Computer Science department by attending their <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/current-students/undergraduates/how-advising-works-computer-science-department" target="_blank">drop-in hours</a> in 1210 Siebel Center.</p><br>
		<p>Once a student has met the transfer requirements, they may apply to transfer through the college of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Speak with an advisor in the LAS Administrative Office in 2002 Lincoln Hall about the <a href="http://www.las.illinois.edu/students/programs/declaring/" target="_blank">process specific to transferring in from your current major.</a></p><br>
